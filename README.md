# How it works
Below is a screenshot demonstrating how the extension works by bolding out the initial parts of all text on any page when clicked. There are toggles and sliders to customize it to your preference so you can enjoy your time reading. You must agree this is awesome right?

# What is Bionic Reading?
Bionic Reading is a new method facilitating the reading process by guiding the eyes through text with artficial fixation points.
As a result, the reader is only focusing on the highlighted initial letters and lets the brain center complete the word.
In a digital world dominated by shallow forms of reading, Bionic Reading aims to encourage a more in-depth reading and understanding of written content.
